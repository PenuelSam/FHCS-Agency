              First Haven Care Solutions is a family-owned care agency dedicated
              to providing care workers to the domiciliary homes of the under

              but also general care. We can also be described as a fully-managed
              live-in care agency regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC)
              and as a whole, our carers are direct employees of our company,
              which means that the company manages our carer’s pay, benefits,
              holidays and pension. We strive on making client homes a first
              stop haven where they will feel safe always, where they have
              confidence that they will be provided with an excellent and
