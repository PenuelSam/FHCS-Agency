        question: "Dementia",
        answer: "Dementia is a relatively common condition, with the risk of developing dementia increasing as you get older. This condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65. Dementia is associated with an ongoing decline in the brain and its abilities and can include problems with: (1) memory loss (long and short term) (2) the speed at which they think (3) mental agility (4) language (5) understanding of a situation (6) judgement.... Often people with dementia can become uninterested in activities they were previously interested in and can also have difficulty controlling their emotions. A person with dementia may begin to find it difficult to plan or organise events which can cause them to forget to have meals or take medication, which makes leading an independent life more challenging.",

        question: "Alzhemier ",
        answer: " The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer’s and according to the NHS it affects an estimated 850,000 people in the UK. Over the course of the disease proteins build up in the brain and form structures which are called ‘tangles’ or ‘plaques’. These structures can lead to the loss of connections between nerve cells, and ultimately to the death of nerve cells and loss of brain tissue. The cause of Alzheimer’s is not known but there are thought to be a number of factors that can increase your risks of developing the condition that include: (1) increasing age (2) a family history of Alzheimer’s (3) previous severe head injuries (4) conditions associated with cardiovascular disease ",
